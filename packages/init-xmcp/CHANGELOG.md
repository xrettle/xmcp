## 1.1.1

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

## 1.0.0

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- b7a2b3c: Move the development compiler into `@xmcp-dev/compiler` so production `xmcp` installs contain only the self-contained runtime. Existing `xmcp dev`, `xmcp build`, and `xmcp create` commands remain available through a runtime-package shim, but projects must add `@xmcp-dev/compiler` as a development dependency.

## 0.7.1

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- d5c0f46: Add a Fastify adapter, serve the MCP Server Card at
  `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`, fix stateless HTTP handling of repeated
  `clientInfo` headers, and update dependencies to resolve known security
  advisories.
