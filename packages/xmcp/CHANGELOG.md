# xmcp

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ca4841: Add request-local `set`/`get` values and `progress`/`log` helpers to `getRequestContext()`. Progress is optional without a request token, and logging respects the SDK's capability and level checks.
- b5ca4c8: Add `getRequestContext()` for read-only access to client identity, HTTP request details, and the cancellation signal from tool handlers and their async helpers.

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- e2c4a5b: Fix Vercel deployments logging `Vercel Runtime Timeout Error: Task timed out after 300 seconds` on every cold start. The build copied `dist/http.js` into the function, and that entry starts a server of its own and exports nothing. Vercel's Node launcher fell back to serving the port the entry listened on, and the listening socket kept the instance's event loop alive: the invocation that booted the server never settled and was killed once the function's maximum duration was reached, even though the response had already been sent in milliseconds. The instance died with it, so the next request cold started and repeated the cycle.

  `--vercel` builds now use a runtime that exports a request handler and never listens, so the platform owns the server and each invocation ends with its response. Standalone (`dist/http.js`), adapter, and Cloudflare builds are unchanged.

## 1.1.2

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 01faeb8: Fix `xmcp build --cf` / `xmcp dev --cf` failing with `Module not found: Can't resolve '.../node_modules/xmcp/src/runtime/platforms/cloudflare/worker.ts'` since `src/` stopped shipping in the published package (0.7.1). The Cloudflare worker runtime is now prebuilt into `dist/runtime/cloudflare-worker.js` like the other runtimes, and the compiler uses that artifact as the `--cf` entry instead of bundling xmcp's TypeScript source from `node_modules`.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- bbe742e: Add `extra.sample()` so tool handlers can request LLM completions from the connected client via MCP sampling (`sampling/createMessage`), mirroring `extra.elicit()`. Supports text/image/audio messages, `systemPrompt`, `maxTokens`, `modelPreferences`, `temperature`, `stopSequences`, `includeContext`, and `metadata`, and exports the `SampleRequest`/`SampleResult` types. The `tools`/`toolChoice` sampling loop and task-augmented sampling are rejected with a clear error until the client tool-call flow is wired.

## 1.0.0

### Patch Changes

- 10bdd57: Upgrade to MCP protocol revision 2026-07-28 via the TypeScript SDK v2 (`@modelcontextprotocol/server` and `@modelcontextprotocol/client` replace the v1 `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` monolith as optional peers, bundled into the runtime).
  - All transports (HTTP, STDIO, Cloudflare Workers, Next.js/Express/Fastify/NestJS adapters) serve both protocol generations: 2026-07-28 envelope requests (including `server/discover`, `resultType`, cacheable list results) natively, and 2025-era clients through the SDK's stateless fallback. HTTP stays strictly stateless — a fresh server per request on both paths.
  - New multi round-trip input API for tools: `inputRequired`, `acceptedContent`, `inputResponse`, and `createRequestStateCodec` are re-exported from `xmcp`, and tool extras expose `inputResponses`/`requestState`. Tools returning `inputRequired(...)` serve both eras (the legacy shim converts to real elicitation for 2025 clients). `extra.elicit()` keeps working on 2025-era connections and throws a descriptive error on 2026-07-28 requests.
  - Tool/prompt/resource schemas are registered through the Standard Schema interface with per-field conversion, keeping the `zod ^3.25.76 || ^4.0.0` peer range working without cross-instance zod composition.
  - Default CORS `allowedHeaders` now include the `Mcp-Method` and `Mcp-Name` headers required on Streamable HTTP POSTs by 2026-07-28.
  - Client helpers (`createHTTPClient`, `createSTDIOClient`) negotiate the protocol version automatically (`server/discover` probe with fallback to `initialize`).
  - Server bundles remain single-file (the SDK's lazy validator imports are inlined by the compiler and the runtime prebuild).
  - Fix: the Express adapter no longer references never-injected CORS globals; it reads the injected `HTTP_CORS_CONFIG` like the other adapters.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- b7a2b3c: Move the development compiler into `@xmcp-dev/compiler` so production `xmcp` installs contain only the self-contained runtime. Existing `xmcp dev`, `xmcp build`, and `xmcp create` commands remain available through a runtime-package shim, but projects must add `@xmcp-dev/compiler` as a development dependency.

### Patch Changes

- b7a2b3c: Reduce published and generated bundle sizes by loading prebuilt runtime files from disk, avoiding vendored install duplicates, and removing compiler-only schema and terminal dependencies from runtime bundles.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- Split the development compiler into `@xmcp-dev/compiler`. Existing `xmcp dev`,
  `xmcp build`, and `xmcp create` scripts continue to work through a small shim,
  but projects must install the matching compiler version as a development
  dependency: `npm i -D @xmcp-dev/compiler@0.8.0`.
- Production installs no longer include Rspack or TypeScript. Built HTTP and
  stdio artifacts remain self-contained and can run without `node_modules`.
- Added the `xmcp/config` export so compiler validation uses the config schema
  from the installed runtime package.

### Patch Changes

- Removed the duplicate runtime embedded in the CLI and removed compiler-only
  schema and Chalk code from the HTTP runtime.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- e3a9f60: Stop shipping `src` in the published package. Every entry point in `main`,
  `types`, `bin`, `exports`, and `typesVersions` resolves into `dist`, and no
  source maps reference `src`, so the directory was dead weight in the tarball:
  223 files down to 71.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- d5c0f46: Add a Fastify adapter, serve the MCP Server Card at
  `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`, fix stateless HTTP handling of repeated
  `clientInfo` headers, and update dependencies to resolve known security
  advisories.
