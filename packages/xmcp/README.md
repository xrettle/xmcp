## The TypeScript MCP Framework

`xmcp` is a framework for building and shipping MCP servers with TypeScript. Designed with DX in mind, it streamlines development and lowers the barrier to entry for anyone looking to create and deploy powerful tools on top of the Model Context Protocol ecosystem.

## Getting Started

Bootstrap your first `xmcp` application with:

```bash
npx create-xmcp-app@latest
```

or initialize `xmcp` on an existing Next.js or Express project with:

```bash
npx init-xmcp@latest
```

## Features

⊹ **File System Routing** - Tools and prompts are auto-registered from a `tools` and `prompts` directory\
⊹ **Hot Reloading** - Instant development feedback\
⊹ **Middlewares** - Toolkit for shipping authentication and custom middlewares\
⊹ **Extensible Configuration** - Customizable configuration for your MCP server\
⊹ **Deploy Anywhere** - Flexible deployment across any platform\
⊹ **Vercel Support** - Zero-configuration deployment with Vercel

## Learn more

⊹ Visit [xmcp.dev](https://xmcp.dev) to learn more about the project.\
⊹ Visit [xmcp.dev/docs](https://xmcp.dev/docs) to view the full documentation.

## Tool Elicitation

Tool handlers can request user input with `extra.elicit()`:

```ts
export default async function (_args, extra) {
  const result = await extra.elicit({
    message: "Choose a deployment target",
    requestedSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        environment: {
          type: "string",
          title: "Environment",
          enum: ["staging", "production"],
        },
      },
      required: ["environment"],
    },
  });

  if (result.action !== "accept" || !result.content) {
    return "Deployment cancelled.";
  }

  return `Deploying to ${result.content.environment}`;
}
```

Form mode is intentionally limited to flat primitive fields and string enums.
Use URL mode for auth, API key, payment, or other sensitive flows.
